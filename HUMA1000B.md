Hobby: Take picture and show-off

Photo Scandal, IPRS question

Why delete the photo? Not handsome, bad photography skills. Do you regularly clean up the desktop of your laptop? Compare to ignoring, why delete the photo? 

If share, then you will lose the trust of my other friends. Besides very good talented students, normally we don't have times to complete all assignments. When somebody send you a source/home work, you don't? Again, your self-interest, might harm you in the long run. A long term self-interest. 

Anyone in this room love taxation? If you won something in lucky draw, will you share with public through charity? Paying attention to self-interest, this is not problematics. 

Benefit friend, draw a clear line, benefit who they know. If you have to share your salary, then the first one should be your family and friends. Everyone can have a reason to stand by your choice.

Will you change your decision, if you realize that keeping the photos is against the law?

What is the reason behind the change of behavior? Not worth the risk of violating the law? The factor affecting your self interest change, it changes your life. Because the effect the law. Following the law align with self-interest. Punish the one acting inproperly. No effect to educate everyone.

Law capture an important feature. Strongly influence by our interest might not be aware. We try to choose the choices that aligns with our self interest. 

Some politician. according to law. keeping such kind of pictures are not forbidden by law. So the police made a false statement. Sending to friends does not violate the law. Post them to internet would be in breach of the law. 

- [ ] check out video 30-40 minutes to know what would be on the quiz.

Who make the same choice in three scenario. I will not send because does not wnat to hurt the trust. Who in the whole process will share the photo to the public? Who take the risk to try to benefit the society. The answer of utilitarianism, public interest comes first. 
Anyone choose to distribute, because you think you will not get caught. 

On one hand there are laws. or somebody is there to transcend the law. classically, if you are such talent, you would believe that no one in police force.

[Lecture Slide about BU event.]

Something happened in BUHK, some student storm the language center to complain mandarin chinese language requirement.

Public opinion: student shouldn't use foul language during their movement. Too aggressive and didn't respect teacher.

Mandarin course not interesting, useless: in the sense that in moral discussion: no agreed ground for discussion? A say A B said B not agreement on anything 

Will not stop if without conclusion. Why dont spend time to make money.

We now have Utilitarianism. If somebody criticize them using foul language, in what sense, foul L should never be used. How to define which word are foul language? What is foul language? May not be foul language? Maybe part of the culture, low income and low educated: common language. He is forbidden to use foul languages. 

The students are too aggressive and shouldn't be like this. 

How to say a language is too aggressive? heartbeat, blood pressure, Student should respect teachers no matter how the teacher treats you? Sexual harassment? Mutual respect is what you expected and this is justifiable. Moral requirement that student should respect teacher? 

Code of conduct of HKUST. will you be punished by UST if you disrespect your teacher. Maybe the university does not care? 

Didn't make it care studnet should respect? Then is it wrong to not respect teacher? 

For moral discussion, we don't have experiment. 

Meaningful discussion: conclusion is verifiable, always come up with solid conclusion. 
Common ground of moral discussion.

`Principle of Utility`: by Jeremy Bentham: .**Always choose whether action or social policy would have the best consequence for everyone concerned.**

Moral Discussion and conduct are a lot of times dominated by religious belief and opinions of royal families or who with authority to make law. 

Bring the power of making moral judgement to everybody, not king, cultural belief, god. 

Agreeable evidence that is shared among human beings. 

Characteristic: Very aggressive, because rule breakers they are. They only trust reasoning. 

Whether a policy is good or not? E.g. Curriculum reform. what is plan, what is going on, what is conclusion, and what we have to do.

Utilitarianism: the consequence is good, then you do it. A subset of consequentialism. 
If one day, student found that CCC is bad. then by all means you have to do curriculum reform. We do not need to care about what is the action and means you take.

### What is the shared unit of utility?

Bentham tries to capture the idea from hedonist? Agreeable among human being regardless of the social background. Just like Edison Scandal. Only personal enjoyment

Utilitarianism: public good rather than personal enjoyment. It is possible that some of the public member would sacrifice.

Historically speaking, Utilitarianism has root in historical use.

attractive feature: the idea of evil consideration: rich people are always minority.

Based on principle of utility: pleasure against suffering, regardless of social status, gender, color, not one should be ignored in moral discussion. 

This is very attractive to the public opinion. Intentionally or unintentionally, try to treat pleasure against suffering as the unit of measurement. This become very strong argument to support animal rights? Why take care of animals? 

`Idea of Equal Consideration` 

In hong kong, no space and need to keep space for animals. Unlike traditional ideas in catholic religion when human have souls.

Do not quantify the unit of measure? 

For utilitarianism, every body is considered in moral discussion. But does not mean there will be equal treatment in the end. A policy agreeing to homosexual marriage, they can still say that HM is a bad taste. HM does not affect their life tho even if they do not like it. If HM does not affect the chance of picking of partner. Such policy only benefit the minority and does not harm the majority a lot. 

**Apply the idea to the essay?**

Lifeboat dilemma: Who should be considered in the case? The three people involved, or the whole world?

Factors affect the consequences: who has better chance to survive? Who contributes more to the world.
