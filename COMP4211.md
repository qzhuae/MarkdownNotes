# COMP4211 Intro to Machine Learning

## Introduction [Jan 31]

Three major problem types:
- Supervised Learning: well-posed
- Unsupervised leanring: ill-posed
- Reinforcement Learning: well-posed but less mature

Conventional Programming vs. Supervised Learning Difference

### Supervised Learning
Training set $\mathcal{S} = \{(x^{(l)}, y^{(l)})\}$ of $N$ labeled examples each of which is in the form of an input-output pair. The problem is to find function $f(\cdot)$ using $\mathcal{S}$. Want $f(x) = y$ to hold also for unseen examples sampled from the same data distribution.

Testing set Unlabeled examples with only input variables are fed one at a time in to function $f$ 

Types of Supervised Learning Problems:
Two main types: `Classification` output is categorical and `Regression` output is continuous-valued
Variations and generalizations:
- Ranking
- Structured prediction
- Active Learning
- Semi-supervised learning

 - [ ] Should you encode categorical data just as 1,2,3? No. Why? 
 A common way to do it is (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)

### Unsupervised Learning
Given a set $\mathcal{S} = \{x^{(l)}\}$ of $N$ unlabeled examples

Unsupervised Learning problems include:
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering
- Density estimation
- Anomaly detection: detecting outliers in the examples

### Reinforcement Learning

A reinforcement learning agent learns via interacting with the environment
Goal: Maximize rewards by learning to take appropriate actions at different states

[Notes about Linear Regression on paper]

### Nonlinear Extension

- Applying a nonlinear regression function to the original input
- Explicitly adding more input dimensions (which depend nonlinearly on the original input dimensions) and applying linear regression to the expanded input. [**Force linearity by adding dimension**]
- Implicitly transforming the original input nonlinearly to a new space and applying a linear model to the transformed input

**Polynomial Regression**
- One common approach is to introduce higher-order terms as additional input dimensions
- Besides adding higher-order terms, more general transformations of the original input dimensions may also be introduced as additional input dimensions.
- Very often, feature engineering that uses domain knowledge to deﬁne application-speciﬁc features is applied.
- The method of least squares for linear regression can also be used here (for both polynomial regression and more general extensions) to obtain a closed-form solution.
