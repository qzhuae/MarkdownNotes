# COMP4211 Intro to Machine Learning

## Introduction [Jan 31]

Three major problem types:
- Supervised Learning: well-posed
- Unsupervised leanring: ill-posed
- Reinforcement Learning: well-posed but less mature

Problem
Training set $\mathcal{S} = \{(x^{(l)}, y^{(l)})\}$ of $N$ labeled examples each of which is in the form of an input-output pair. The problem is to find function $f(\cdot)$ using $\mathcal{S}$. 

Testing set Unlabeled examples with only input variables are fed one at a time in to function $f$
