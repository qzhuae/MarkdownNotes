- Creativity, Characteristics of innovators (inventors)
- Sources of innovation

[Page 3] Some Examples

[Page 4] Some of the Most Important Technological Innovations - A chronology

### Technological Innovations: Changing Industrial Pictures
- Advances in IT (e.g. CAD/CAM, ERP, SCM, Internet) have played a role in speeding the pace of innovation
- [ ] What is CAM, ERP, SCM
- Flexible manufacturing technologies enable firms to produce multiple product variations (Samsung, Toyota)
- Real-time information on demand becomes available (e.g. Big Data, IoT, Machine Learning)
- Firms and consumers interact to create new things (open innovation/collaboration)
- New technologies are combined to create new products, services and businesses (convergences)
- [ ] Are these called *Convergences* or what?

**Autonomous Driving Cars**
CES 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018
Mercedes Benz, Audi, Lexus, BMW
NVDIA, MobileEye, AMD, Intel, Samsung
- [ ] What is the prof trying to say with this example?
- [ ] What is possibly going to happen?

**Education Industry**
MOOC (Massive Open Online Course): Open Culture, Open Yale Courses, Edx, Coursera
- [ ] What is possibly going to happen in the education industry?

**Tesla** [Page 8]
- [ ] What is the point of this slide?

Any American Auto Manufacturing Start-up Since 1920s? Chrysler? Tucker? DeLorean?
- [ ] What is the point of this slide? [Page 9]

**Tesla** again [Page 10]
*Tesla’s ambition*
- Not merely to win the title of hottest car in Silicon Valley
- To simultaneously become the next Ford Motor and ExxonMobil
- To be a profitable, mass-scale manufacturer and fuel
*From Tesla's webpage*,
- “Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable transport (energy)”
- “Tesla is not an automaker, but also a technology and design company with a focus on energy innovation”

### The Importance of Technological Innovation
- Firms rely on products developed within the past five years for more than 1/3 of their sales and profits (Barczak et al., 2009)
	- Johnson & Johnson (30% of sales), 3M (45% of sales)
- *Fierce competition* due to the market globalization and technology equalization across firms (and countries) has put pressure on firms to continuously innovate *to produce differentiated products and services*
