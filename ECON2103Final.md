[A couple of curves] The cost of production

- [ ] check photos taken in class

# ELEC2400
- [ ] Sketch of exponential
- [ ] Energy consumption
- [ ] How to determine when a diode is on?
- [ ] Why current, voltage is consistent in inductor/capacitor
- [ ] Max power consumption, usually is when load = internal resistance

For capacitor, i leads v. For inductor, v leads i.
