## Data Warehouse

`Online Analytical Processing` OLAP

Data Warehouse stores pre-computed results to have __fast query response__

Parts are bought from suppliers and then sold to customers at a sale price SP

| part        | supplier         | customer  | SP |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:| :---: |
|p1|s1|c1|4|
|p3|s1|c2|3|
|p2|s3|c1|7|
|...|...|...|...|

Consider a data cube with dimensions, c, p, s.

__Example 1__

Select part, customer, SUM(SP) from table T group by part, customer

We can also use AVG(SP), MAX(SP), MIN(SP)

__Example 2__

Select customer, SUM(SP) from table T group by customer

`Materialize` all views wastes a lot of space. 

* Materialize the top view only

* Materialize the top view and the view for ps only

Gain({view for ps, top view}, {top view}) = 5.2 * 3 = 15.6
