Profit = TR - TC, Costs are always `economic costs`
Economic Profits vs. Accounting Profits

> Factor of production owned or provided by firm or entrepreneur. If the firm own capital and uses it to produce its output, then the firm incurs an **opportunity cost**. Because the firm can receive compensation or income by selling or renting the capital to other firms.

Opportunity cost includes:
- Explicit costs (there is an outlay of money)
- Implicit costs (no cash outlay) e.g. owner's time

AP = TR - TEC; EP = AP - TIC

`The Production Function` Q_out over Q_in (can be table, equation, or graph)
(Quantity of outputs over Quantity of inputs)

`marginal product` (derivative, slope of PF) MP of Labor = $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$ 
>  increase in output arising from one additional unit of that input, every other inputs constant. 

Think at the margin: additional input if MP > MC

**MPL diminishes as L rises** whether the fixed input is land or capital (equipment, mahchines), interpret as additional worker being less productive.

`Diminishing marginal product` MP $\downarrow$ as $Q_{in} \uparrow$, other things equal.
