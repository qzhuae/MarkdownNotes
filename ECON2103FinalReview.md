## Some Principles

difference between curve and quantity

## Chapter 13

Profit = TR - TC, Costs are always `economic costs`
Economic Profits vs. Accounting Profits

> Factor of production owned or provided by firm or entrepreneur. If the firm own capital and uses it to produce its output, then the firm incurs an **opportunity cost**. Because the firm can receive compensation or income by selling or renting the capital to other firms.

Opportunity cost includes:
- Explicit costs (there is an outlay of money)
- Implicit costs (no cash outlay) e.g. owner's time

AP = TR - TEC; EP = AP - TIC

`The Production Function` Q_out over Q_in (can be table, equation, or graph)
(Quantity of outputs over Quantity of inputs)

`marginal product` (derivative, slope of PF) MP of Labor = $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$ 
>  increase in output arising from one additional unit of that input, every other inputs constant. 

Think at the margin: additional input if MP > MC

**MPL diminishes as L rises** whether the fixed input is land or capital (equipment, mahchines), interpret as additional worker being less productive.

`Diminishing marginal product` MP $\downarrow$ as $Q_{in} \uparrow$, other things equal.

`Fixed Costs` Cost of equipment, loan payments, rent, land
`Variable Costs` Cost of materials, wages
`Total Costs` TC = FC + VC
`Total Cost Curve` over $Q_{out}$

`Marginal Cost` MC = $\frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q_{out}}$
> increase in total cost from producing one more unit

AFC, AVC, ATC

**U-shaped ATC** 
> Q rises, falling AFC pulls ATC down; Rising AVC pulls ATC up
> When MC < ATC, ATC is falling and when MC > ATC, ATC is rising

`Efficient scale` The quantity that minimizes ATC.

MC and AC in a TC Graph
MC: slope
AC: origin-point line

AP-MP, AC-MC plot

At low Q, MPL $\uparrow$ and AVC $\downarrow$
At high Q, MPL $\downarrow$ and AVC $\uparrow$

In short run, some inputs are fixed (e.g. factories, land). The costs of these inputs are FC. 

In long run, all inputs are variable (e.g. firms can build more factories or sell existing ones). 

In the long run,
> ATC at any Q is cost per unit using the most efficient mix of inputs for that Q

(factory size with the lowest)
