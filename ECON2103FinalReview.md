# Econ2103 Final Review

## Some Principles

difference between curve and quantity

## Chapter 13

Profit = TR - TC, Costs are always `economic costs`
Economic Profits vs. Accounting Profits

> Factor of production owned or provided by firm or entrepreneur. If the firm own capital and uses it to produce its output, then the firm incurs an **opportunity cost**. Because the firm can receive compensation or income by selling or renting the capital to other firms.

Opportunity cost includes:
- Explicit costs (there is an outlay of money)
- Implicit costs (no cash outlay) e.g. owner's time

AP = TR - TEC; EP = AP - TIC

`The Production Function` Q_out over Q_in (can be table, equation, or graph)
(Quantity of outputs over Quantity of inputs)

`marginal product` (derivative, slope of PF) MP of Labor = $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$ 
>  increase in output arising from one additional unit of that input, every other inputs constant. 

Think at the margin: additional input if MP > MC

**MPL diminishes as L rises** whether the fixed input is land or capital (equipment, mahchines), interpret as additional worker being less productive.

`Diminishing marginal product` MP $\downarrow$ as $Q_{in} \uparrow$, other things equal.

`Fixed Costs` Cost of equipment, loan payments, rent, land
`Variable Costs` Cost of materials, wages
`Total Costs` TC = FC + VC
`Total Cost Curve` over $Q_{out}$

`Marginal Cost` MC = $\frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q_{out}}$
> increase in total cost from producing one more unit

AFC, AVC, ATC

**U-shaped ATC** 
> Q rises, falling AFC pulls ATC down; Rising AVC pulls ATC up
> When MC < ATC, ATC is falling and when MC > ATC, ATC is rising

`Efficient scale` The quantity that minimizes ATC.

[Know how to draw TC & VC curves and relation with AC MC]

MC and AC in a TC Graph
MC: slope
AC: origin-point line

AP-MP, AC-MC plot

At low Q, MPL $\uparrow$ and AVC $\downarrow$
At high Q, MPL $\downarrow$ and AVC $\uparrow$

In short run, some inputs are fixed (e.g. factories, land). The costs of these inputs are FC. 

In long run, all inputs are variable (e.g. firms can build more factories or sell existing ones). 

In the long run,
- ATC at any Q is cost per unit using the most efficient mix of inputs for that Q
- This is the factory size with the lowest ATC
- Number of plants increases, output of a given number of labor increases.
- For each plant, as the quantity of labor increases, diminishing MP occurs

Each size of plant, has a short-run ATC curve. The long-run average cost curve (LRAC) is made up from the lowest ATC for each output level.

`Long-run Average Cost Curve` relationship between the lowest attainable average total cost and output when both the plant and labor are varied. 

LRAC tells the size of plant that minimizes the cost of producing a given output.

`Economies of scale`
ATC $\downarrow$ as Q $\uparrow$
increasing production allows greater specialization
workers are more efficient when focusing on narrow task
more common when Q is low

 `Constant returns to scale` 
ATC stays the same as Q $\uparrow$

`Diseconomies of scale`
due to coordination issue in large organizations, more common when Q is high

## Chapter 14

PC: $\infty$ buyers and sellers, same good, free entry and free exit

MR = P is only true for firms in PC, because PC firm increase Q without changing P

Profit Maximization Rule: MC = MR

MC curve determines PC firm's Q at any price, thus is supply curve for the firm

Shutdown in SR, still pay FC. Exit in LR, zero costs.

`Sunk Cost` should be irrelevant to decisions. FC is sunk cost in SR.

Shutdown Decision:
TR < VC = cost saved, P = AR < AVC.

Max Profit might not be positive economic profit. (check by ATC vs P)

`Shutdown Point` at min AVC where MC crosses AVC. Indifferent between producing and shutting down.  At this point, loss is TFC.

Exit Decision:
TR < TC = cost saved, P = AR < AVC.

Enter Decision: TR > TC, P > ATC

**SR Market Supply Curve**
As long as P >= AVC, each firm will do MR = MC. MC above AVC

**LR Market Supply Curve**
MC above ATC

Market Supply Assumption:
- All firm same cost
- Costs are constant
- Number of firms is fixed in short run, variable in long run

Positive economic profit, new firms enter, SR market supply shifts right
Negative economic profit, some firms exit, SR market supply shifts left

`The Zero-profit condition`
Long-run equilibrium, the process of entry or exit is complete-remaining firms earn zero economic profit when P = ATC.

PM => P = MR = MC = ATC => minimum ATC

`LR Market Supply Curve` 
LR market supply curve is horizontal at P = min ATC



## Practice Final Summary

### Chapter 13

TP is convex first and then concave because MP rise first and then decrease.

TC is concave first and then convex because MC decrease first and then rise. starts from positive value.

MP and MC are like reciprocal, when MP rise MC decrease and MP decrease and MC rise. 

MP decrease: each additional worker produces less and less output
MC increase: each unit requires more and more workers => more cost => higher MC

MC is U-shaped, but rises steeply as output increases. This is due to diminishing marginal product. 

ATC is U-shaped. Q low, ATC decrease. Q high, ATC increase.

MC < ATC, ATC is falling; cost of last unit produced pulls the average down.
MC > ATC, ATC is rising; cost of last unit produced pulls the average up.

Low Q, ATC is much higher than AVC as AFC is large
High Q, ATC is close to AVC as AFC is small
