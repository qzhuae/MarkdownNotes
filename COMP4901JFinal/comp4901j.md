## Topic 8 Deep Learning Software

CPU: Fewer Cores, Each core is much faster and much more capable; great at sequential tasks
GPU: More Cores, but each core is much slower and "dumber"; great for parallel tasks

Training can bottleneck on reading data and transferring to GPU!

Solutions:
- Read all data into RAM
- Use SSD instead of HDD
- Use multiple CPU threads to pre-fetch data

Deep Learning Frameworks:
- Easily build big computational graphs
- Easily compute gradients in computational graphs
- Run it all efficiently on GPU

Computational Graphs:
- Cannot run on GPU
- Have to compute own gradients

[TensorFlow Example] Train a two-layer ReLU network on random data with L2 Loss

what is `tf.reduce_mean`?

Problem with `tf.placeholder`; copying weights between CPU/GPU each step is heavy. Use `tf.Variable` instead
