## Topic 8 Deep Learning Software

CPU: Fewer Cores, Each core is much faster and much more capable; great at sequential tasks
GPU: More Cores, but each core is much slower and "dumber"; great for parallel tasks

Training can bottleneck on reading data and transferring to GPU!

Solutions:
- Read all data into RAM
- Use SSD instead of HDD
- Use multiple CPU threads to pre-fetch data

Deep Learning Frameworks:
- Easily build big computational graphs
- Easily compute gradients in computational graphs
- Run it all efficiently on GPU

Computational Graphs:
- Cannot run on GPU
- Have to compute own gradients

[TensorFlow Example] Train a two-layer ReLU network on random data with L2 Loss

what is `tf.reduce_mean`?

Problem with `tf.placeholder` (fed on each call); copying weights between CPU/GPU each step is heavy. Use `tf.Variable` instead (persists in the graph between calls).

`assign()` operation. Also need a dummy graph node that depends on updates. 

Gradients can also be computed and weights can be updated with an optimizer.

    N, D, H = 
    x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(N,D))
    y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(N,D))
    w1 = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal((D,H)))
    w2 = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal((H,D)))
    
    h = tf.maximum(tf.matmul(x,w1),0)
    y_pred = tf.matmul(h,w2)
    loss = tf.losses.mean_squared_error(y_pred,y)
    #diff = y_pred - y
    #loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.reduce_sum(diff*diff, axis=1))

`Keras`: High-level Wrapper

PyTorch: Three Levels of Abstraction
- Tensor: Imperative ndarray; but runs on GPU (Numpy Array)
- Variable: Node in a computational  graph; stores data and gradient (Tensor, Variable, Placeholder)
- Module: A neural network layer; may store state or learnable weights (tf.layers, TFSlim, TFLearn)
