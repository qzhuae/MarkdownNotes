# ECON2123 Introduction to Macroeconomics

## Feb 12 Lecture 1 Overview & Key concepts

How to describe an economy? Output, Population, Output per Person, Share of World Output

For US:
Accounted for 23% of world output. 
Standard of living is high: Output per capita close to the highest in the world.
[Standard of living ~ Output per Capita]

Output growth rate, unemployment rate, inflation definition

Can get basic idea about how this economy is growing.

Is lower inflation good? Every supply level is going higher. In expansion period, we will have high inflation rate. However, inflation rate should not be too high. There is a optimal range for inflation rate.

The tables in P8-P9 is in Chapter 1 of the textbook.

Three Key Variables:
- Output
- Unemployment rate
- Inflation rate

How to measure `aggregate output`?
National income and product accounts (`National income accouts` in short) are an accounting system used to measure aggregate economic activity.

`GDP (Gross Domestic Product)` is measured from either perspective.
- `Expenditure Approach` - Total **expenditure** on (purchase of) **domestically-produced** final goods and services. If imported from other country, will not be included in the GDP of this country.
- `Income Approach` - Total **income** earned by **domestically-located** factors of production. [Worker, Capital]
- Expenditure equals income because every dollar spent by a buyer becomes income of the seller. Expenditure Approach = Income Approach
- Income earned by a Hong Kong citizen counted into HKâ€™s GDP or not? If she works in HK, then it is counted in HK's GDP. If she works in US, then it is counted in US' GDP.
- Income earned by a foreigner in HK is counted HK's GDP.

In the open economy, will be adjustment. If one of hong kong's company but is exported to foreign company. But export will count in HK's GDP. Will be adjusted for import and export. Consumer's expenditure.

C+I+G + X - IM (addressed the question in CH3)

### Three ways of defining GDP

- GDP is the value of the *final* goods and services produced in the economy *during a given period*
	- `Final Good`: Destined for final consumption
	- `Intermediate Good`: Input of the production of another good or service. Does not count in GDP to avoid double counting
		- This will be different in open economy, steel for foreign company to produce car. There needs to be adjustment. 
		- Purpose of the use of a good determine whether it is final or intermediate good. For example, an air conditioner: Final good for a household, but intermediate good for a restaurant. Final good for consumer and intermediate good for other firms. There are other examples in textbook.

GDP is a `flow variable` must be measured in a given period. Can not be counted in any given point of time.

`stock variable` must be measured at certain point of time.

Example on P14:
Firm 1 does not use any intermediate input. only factors of production. Because GDP is the value of final goods and services. In this case, final good is car. So the GDP in this case is \$200.

- GDP is the sum of the **valued added** in the economy during a given period.
	- Value added equals to the value of a firm's production minus the value of the intermediate goods it uses in production. For firm 1, it is 100 and for firm 2, it is 200 - 100 = 100.
- GDP is the sum of **incomes** in the economy during a given period 
	- Aggregate income and aggregate production are equal.
