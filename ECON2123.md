For US:
Accounted for 23% of world output. 
Standard of living is high: Output per capita close to the highest in the world.
[Standard of living ~ Output per Capita]

Output growth rate, unemployment rate, inflation definition

Can get basic idea about how this economy is growing.

Is lower inflation good? Every supply level is going higher. In expansion period, we will have high inflation rate. However, inflation rate should not be too high. There is a optimal range for inflation rate.

The tables in P8-P9 is in Chapter 1 of the textbook.

Three Key Variables:
- Output
- Unemployment rate
- Inflation rate

How to measure `aggregate output`?
National income and product accounts (`National income accouts` in short) are an accounting system used to measure aggregate economic activity.

`GDP (Gross Domestic Product)` is measured from either perspective.
- `Expenditure Approach` - Total **expenditure** on (purchase of) **domestically-produced** final goods and services. If imported from other country, will not be included in the GDP of this country.
- `Income Approach` - Total **income** earned by **domestically-located** factors of production. [Worker, Capital, ]
