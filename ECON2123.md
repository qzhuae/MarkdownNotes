# ECON2123 Introduction to Macroeconomics

## Feb 12 Lecture 1 Overview & Key concepts

How to describe an economy? Output, Population, Output per Person, Share of World Output

For US:
Accounted for 23% of world output. 
Standard of living is high: Output per capita close to the highest in the world.
[Standard of living ~ Output per Capita]

Output growth rate, unemployment rate, inflation definition

Can get basic idea about how this economy is growing.

Is lower inflation good? Every supply level is going higher. In expansion period, we will have high inflation rate. However, inflation rate should not be too high. There is a optimal range for inflation rate.

The tables in P8-P9 is in Chapter 1 of the textbook.

Three Key Variables:
- Output
- Unemployment rate
- Inflation rate

How to measure `aggregate output`?
National income and product accounts (`National income accouts` in short) are an accounting system used to measure aggregate economic activity.

`GDP (Gross Domestic Product)` is measured from either perspective.
- `Expenditure Approach` - Total **expenditure** on (purchase of) **domestically-produced** final goods and services. If imported from other country, will not be included in the GDP of this country.
- `Income Approach` - Total **income** earned by **domestically-located** factors of production. [Worker, Capital]
- Expenditure equals income because every dollar spent by a buyer becomes income of the seller. Expenditure Approach = Income Approach
- Income earned by a Hong Kong citizen counted into HKâ€™s GDP or not? If she works in HK, then it is counted in HK's GDP. If she works in US, then it is counted in US' GDP.
- Income earned by a foreigner in HK is counted HK's GDP.

In the open economy, will be adjustment. If one of hong kong's company but is exported to foreign company. But export will count in HK's GDP. Will be adjusted for import and export. Consumer's expenditure.

C+I+G + X - IM (addressed the question in CH3)

### Three ways of defining GDP

- GDP is the value of the *final* goods and services produced in the economy *during a given period*
	- `Final Good`: Destined for final consumption
	- `Intermediate Good`: Input of the production of another good or service. Does not count in GDP to avoid double counting
		- This will be different in open economy, steel for foreign company to produce car. There needs to be adjustment. 
		- Purpose of the use of a good determine whether it is final or intermediate good. For example, an air conditioner: Final good for a household, but intermediate good for a restaurant. Final good for consumer and intermediate good for other firms. There are other examples in textbook.

GDP is a `flow variable` must be measured in a given period. Can not be counted in any given point of time.

`stock variable` must be measured at certain point of time.

Example on P14:
Firm 1 does not use any intermediate input. only factors of production. Because GDP is the value of final goods and services. In this case, final good is car. So the GDP in this case is \$200.

- GDP is the sum of the **valued added** in the economy during a given period.
	- Value added equals to the value of a firm's production minus the value of the intermediate goods it uses in production. For firm 1, it is 100 and for firm 2, it is 200 - 100 = 100.
- GDP is the sum of **incomes** in the economy during a given period 
	- Aggregate income and aggregate production are equal. Income is equal to wage + corporate income (profits)

### Nominal vs. Real GDP

- `Nominal` GDP is the sum of the quantities of final goods in terms of (measured by) their **current** market prices
	- `Market prices` is determined by demand and supply, a fair measure of value.
- `Real` GDP is constructed as the sum of the quantities of final goods in terms of (measured by) constant prices, e.g., price in a particular year.

Nominal not equal to Real unless price is the same as the base year.

If you change your base year, it does not affect the growth rate of your GDP if you only have one good. If there are multiple goods, but the answer may not hold. 

Chain-type index method -> Will not be tested in the exam.

### Level vs. Growth rate

Real GDP per capita is the ratio of real GDP to the population of the country
GDP growth: $\frac{Y_t - Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}$

Negative growth: recession - short run phenomenon
If it is a long run phenomenon, then we call it depression.

Positive growth: expansion

[Some focus box are important, for example CH3 puzzle, some of them in exam]

**Problem of GDP**: Real GDP, Technological Progress, and the Price of Computers [P22]

What GDP measure? 
- Standard of living?
	- Good and services available for consumption
	- Consumer's valuation on those items.
However, it does not measure:
	- negative impact of pollution 
	- Stress and Tension
	- People's Happiness
[Extra Reading - Singapore, Hong Kong face happiness deficit]

### Unemployment
- Unemployment is the number of people who do not have a job but are looking for one. If not looking for job, then people does not count in unemployment.
- Unemployment Rate = U/L
- `Labor Force` L = N+U, N is employed
Some people are not included: college students, if you are in final year, and if you are looking for job then you will be included.
This also include: Retired seniors.

Why we care about the unemployment rate?
- Direct impact on welfare of the unemployed
- Unemployment means there may be idle resources unused or the economy may not be using its human resources efficiently

Is very low unemployment good? No. If the unemployment rate is very low, there is a shortage of labor force. Reduced bargaining power of employers. There is an optimal range of unemployment rate.

People without jobs who give up looking for work are known as `discouraged workers`.

`Participation rate` = $\frac{Labor Force}{Population of working age}$

Usually a higher unemployment rate is typically associated with a lower participation rate. This is true. This is a typical situation. High unemployment rate will discourage workers. 

[Missing slide - HK unemployment rate]

Since 1960, US unemployment rate fluctuated from 3% and 10%. Going down during expansions and going up during recessions.

### Inflation Rate

Inflation is a **sustained** rise in the **general** level of prices. Not for one single product but for product.
- Sustained: Not just one shot but in continuous fashion
- General: Not just rise of a few items, but rise for general
Why do we care?
- During a period of inflation, prices and wages may not rise proportionately, so inflation affects income distribution / welfare of different groups. E.g. Currently, prices seem rise more than that of wage for low income group. 
- Inflation also lead to other distortions
	- To protect value of saving, people will invest in gold and properties and may lead to sharp rise in their prices (may lead to speculative bubbles)
	- If wage, and all prices are increasing at the same time, then there could be no impact on consumption. However, if they increase at different pace?

How to measure inflation rate?
- The GDP Deflator
	- The GDP deflator in year $t$, $P_t$ is defined as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP in year $t$.
	- Or, Nominal GDP is equal to the GDP deflator multiplied by real GDP: \$ $Y_t = P_t Y_t$ [Notice this dollar sign]
	- GDP deflator is called an `index number`, which set equal to 100 or 1 in the base year and has no economic interpretation.
	- The rate of change in the GDP deflator has a clear interpretation that equals the `inflation rate`: $\pi_t = (P_t - P_{t-1}/P_{t-1})$ 

[Practice Problem] Calculate GDP from previous year

[In this course, GDP usually refers to Real GDP]

**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**
- A measure of the overall level prices of consumption (goods bought by consumers)
- How is it different from GDP deflator? 
- [ ] Check this out
- The set of goods produced in the economy is not the same as the set of goods purchased by consumers, because: 
	- Some of the goods are sold to firms, to government or to foreigners
	- Some of the goods consumed are not produced domestically but are imported from abroad.

The inflation rates, computed using either the CPI or the GDP deflator, are largely similar. The CPI and the GDP deflator move together most of the time. In most years, the two inflation rates differ by less than 1\%. There are clear exceptions, however. E.g., in 1979 and 1980, the increase in the CPI was significantly larger than the increase in the GDP deflator. 

 
CPI vs PPI 

CPI: can be both produced abroad both locally.

PPI: producer price index, price used by producer. Not consumption good.

P35 - P40

### Short, Medium and the Long Run

**Short run**: Up to a few years - change in output is mainly driven by change in demand. We can make some strong assumption, which can be later relaxed demand determine output.
**Medium run**: A decade - Output level is determined supply factors: Capital stock, size of labor force, technology level. supply determines output. supply size: Capital and Labor, determine the equilibrium output, Technology determines productivity.
**Long run**: Few decades or more - accumulation of capital stock and growth in technology level. Still supply side factor, can not just rely on supply size (such as accumulation of capital) why not? Depending on the speed may not cover the long run. Accumulation of capital stock cannot sustain long-run growth. growth in technology level can sustain long run growth. 

It is important to know what "conditions" or "constraints" that an economy behaves as in short, medium and long run.
E.g.  When the economy has many idle capacity and labor, do you think it is under S/M/L run? Medium Run. supply side factor.
Why time horizon is important in defining S/M/L?When time is long enough, prices can adjust to equilibrium. Few years, a decade or few decades just on a  rough basis.
Under different time, we have different assumption. In a short run, price can not change due to price stickiness - assumption.
Given sufficient time. take into account people's expectation of time and price will change. 

We can assume the price does not change. 

How to use macroeconomics model to explain fact: Know which time horizon. 

When you just care about the level, it is ok to look at nominal GDP but keep in mind that you are taking into account of the price effect.

IS-LM can be used in both SR and LR based on different set of assumptions.


## Feb 14 Lecture 2 The Goods Market

First Model: `The Goods Market`

[Loop in P4] Demand determines production, production determines income (Through Production you will earn your income, household income or corporate income), and income determines Demand. `Production`, `Income` and `Demand` form a circle.

`Goods`: generally used to refer to both physical goods and services.

Last lecture, different approach to measure GDP. Today we will use expenditure approach. Expenditure comes from the demand side - spending on goods and services.

[Table in P5] Message here is: There are five components of GDP: Consumption (For US, it is the largest one), Investment, Government Spending (G), Net exports, Inventory investment.

A way to measure the performance of an economy, that is how many an economy produce, including tangible goods and services

**Consumption (C)** Goods and services purchased by consumers.
**Investment (I)** This is different from financial investment. Sometimes called `fixed investment` is the purchase of **new** capital goods, which is the sum of `nonresidential investment` (e.g. new machineries; Firms' purchase of new capital goods: will be used for long-run production purpose but not intermediate good) and `residential investment` (e.g. new housing; One special goods). This is different from `inventory investment`.

Very importantly, we emphasize new capital good. Buying old capital good is not fixed investment for this year. Old house, not in this year's GDP but counted in the first year the housing is sold. Second hand purchase is not counted. That value added is included in past GDP. 

Should we say consumption to do with **new** goods. It is true that we have to emphasize **new**. If you buy second-hand product, is not counted in this year's GDP. It is already counted/measured in the GDP of the past

[Refresh Example] No.3, because does not count financial transaction, we focus on production. 

**Government Spending (G)** Purchases of Goods and Services by governments. It does not include government transfers, nor interest payments on the government debt. Must be purchases of Goods and Services by government. Transfer - payment paid directly to the household, some medical insurance, Pension, health-care. 

Three entity: household, firm, government. We talk about spending. So it is expenditure approach. 

What are government spending: to have public university, hospital, government employee, salary is paid by G. Looks like the governmet  is puchasing  their service from its own employee.

Open Economy: C+I+G+X-IM

**U'*4

In close economy: C+I+G
In open economy: C+I+G+NX

Does not take into constraint, in the MR role. In the 

Implicit assumption.
