## Chapter 1 Introduction to Signals

### Lecture 2 Introduction to Signals and Systems

Signal: A pattern or variation that contains information. A signal can be what we see, hear, touch, smell, taste and visualize. Examples: Audio, image and video signals.
A signal can be contained in what we do not sense directly. Radio, cellular phone, and wireless LAN signal. Gamma ray from the universe. High-energy particle tracks.

Signal Conveys Information. Hang Seng Index, Electrocardiogram, X-ray, Monthly unemployment rate, Movie.
Signals carry information. Signals may bring stimulations and enjoyment.

Often, signal is the variation of some physical quantity **over time**.  For example, variation of HSI over one year. Sound signal - Variation of acoustic pressure over 1/20 of a second.

Signal can be variations of some physical quantity **over space**. 
Brightness of pixels (picture elements) over two-dimensional space. v.s. Brightness of pixels along the selected red line ( one-dimensional space).

Signal can also be variations over **both space and time**. Example: video

But in engineering, it is often very important for us to *think of signals as functions of frequency*.

 - [ ] Check out what is in P10 Discussion.

`Analog Signals` are signals that vary continuously over time with *arbitrary continuous values*. Many real-life quantities such as length, weight, force, acoustic pressure, electrical current, etc., are viewed as analog signals. Acoustic Pressure, Electrical Current.

`Digital Signals` are signals that are defined only *at discrete time instances* and can take on *a finite set of values*. All the signals processed by modern computers are processed as digital signals. Student attendance at lecture, HSI at the end of a day, MP3 music file.

`Conversion between analog and digital signals` We frequently convert between analog and digital signals (e.g. to process analog audio signals by the computer) `Sampling` of analog music signal for storage in a Digital CD. While sampling there is some approximation involved. 

In scientific and engineering studies, everything can be modeled as `systems` with signals as input and signals as output. 

Example Systems: Iphone, Human Auditory, Digital Camera, Bank account
Example Inputs: radio signal, acoustic signal, light signal, deposit/withdrawal interest rate
Example Outputs: audio signal, perception of sound, digital image, account balance
