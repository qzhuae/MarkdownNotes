## Chapter 1 Introduction to Signals

### Lecture 2 Introduction to Signals and Systems

Signal: A pattern or variation that contains information. A signal can be what we see, hear, touch, smell, taste and visualize. Examples: Audio, image and video signals.
A signal can be contained in what we do not sense directly. Radio, cellular phone, and wireless LAN signal. Gamma ray from the universe. High-energy particle tracks.

Signal Conveys Information. Hang Seng Index, Electrocardiogram, X-ray, Monthly unemployment rate, Movie.
Signals carry information. Signals may bring stimulations and enjoyment.

Often, signal is the variation of some physical quantity **over time**.  For example, variation of HSI over one year. Sound signal - Variation of acoustic pressure over 1/20 of a second.

Signal can be variations of some physical quantity **over space**. 
Brightness of pixels (picture elements) over two-dimensional space. v.s. Brightness of pixels along the selected red line ( one-dimensional space).

Signal can also be variations over **both space and time**. Example: video

But in engineering, it is often very important for us to *think of signals as functions of frequency*.

 - [ ] Check out what is in P10 Discussion.

`Analog Signals` are signals that vary continuously over time with *arbitrary continuous values*. Many real-life quantities such as length, weight, force, acoustic pressure, electrical current, etc., are viewed as analog signals. Acoustic Pressure, Electrical Current.

`Digital Signals` are signals that are defined only *at discrete time instances* and can take on *a finite set of values*. All the signals processed by modern computers are processed as digital signals. Student attendance at lecture, HSI at the end of a day, MP3 music file.

`Conversion between analog and digital signals` We frequently convert between analog and digital signals (e.g. to process analog audio signals by the computer) `Sampling` of analog music signal for storage in a Digital CD. While sampling there is some approximation involved. 

In scientific and engineering studies, everything can be modeled as `systems` with signals as input and signals as output. 

Example Systems: Iphone, Human Auditory, Digital Camera, Bank account
Example Inputs: radio signal, acoustic signal, light signal, deposit/withdrawal interest rate
Example Outputs: audio signal, perception of sound, digital image, account balance

`Signals Bring Interactions Among Systems` Output signals from one system is often the input to another system. Signals transfer information from one system to another system and bring interactions among systems.

• A system can be complex!
• E.g. The cell phone is a system that contains several subsystems (i.e. systems within a system), and many sub-subsystems within the sub-systems. The cell phone represents one of the most complex systems ever invented (yet so compact, multi-functional and popular!).

#### Summary
Analog, Digital Signals, Systems

In the next four lectures for this chapter, we focus on **analog signals**, and introduce two fundamental concepts for the understanding of signals and their processing by systems – **spectrum and filtering**.

In Chapters 2, 3 and 4, we will discuss **digitalization of signals** and how digital signals are processed. Digitalization is the foundation of the modern information age.

### Lecture 3 Sound Signal, Frequency and Harmonics

What is sound? What is in the sound signal that determines what we hear?

Sound is an audio signal that we hear through **variations in the air pressure that reaches our ears**.

Atmospheric pressure is ~100,000 Pa

Pascal: measure of pressure, 1 Newton per square meter. Variation of as little as 1 Pa would be deafening sound to our ear.

What is the difference in our perception of the sound (slow down or speed up)? **The pitch of the music that we hear is changed along with the speed we play back the music**.

When we zoom into the plot of the original sound signal to the ~20 ms time scale, we find different repetitive patterns at different parts of the music:

We find that the whole piece of music is actually a sequence of `sound bites`, each lasting a fraction of a second with a recognizable repetitive patterns.

When we plot different sound bites from different sources, we see they are all made up of **repetitive patterns**, or **oscillations**. The pattern may repeat quickly or slowly, look simple or complex, and have a small or large `amplitude`.

It is the `frequency` in the repetitive pattern in each sound bite that leads to our perception of a pitch. **The faster the pattern repeats, the higher the pitch**. Speeding up or slowing down the music leads to a different perception of the “pitch” of the sound that we hear.

A signal that oscillates with a repetitive pattern is called a `periodic signal`. `Period`: The repeating interval of a periodic signal, often notated by T. You typically find a repeating interval from a fraction of 1 ms to several ms in the sound signal we hear.

Engineers also describe a periodic signal by its `fundamental frequency` f which is the reciprocal of the period T. f = 1/T.

The fundamental frequency is the `repetition rate` of the signal. Because period T has units of time, the unit of frequency f is 1/seconds (or Hertz (Hz)).

A simple periodic signal - Sinusoidal Signal
We will now illustrate the perception of pitch by the simplest periodic signal - the sinusoidal signal. (e.g. sound of a tuning fork, or a person whistling) . A sinusoidal signal is also called a sine wave.

Sinusoidal Function in time:
$A \sin(2\pi\cdot f\cdot t)$ t time
Signal amplitude A, Sinusoidal function (the shape of the periodic signal), signal frequency f = 1/T 

T = 2.55ms, f = 1/T = 392 Hz G note in music, a "So" on the C scale.

"Do" 261.63Hz "Re" 293.66 "Me" 329.63 "Far" 349.23 "So" 392 "La" 440 "t" 494

We can  specified this piece of music as **a sequence of music notes**!

Different keys on the piano keyboard produce sounds at specific pitches, called notes, labeled A to G (for the simple scale).

The simple sinusoidal signals we played do not sound like piano notes at all! Their tone sounds “pure” and does not have any “richness!”. In general, when the same note is played or sung by a guitar, a piano, a violin, a flute, you, and me, it sounds different even if it is at the same **pitch (fundamental frequency)** and has the same **loudness (amplitude)**. Why?

Our ears distinguish sounds primarily by distinguishing three attributes of the sound signal: pitch, loudness, and `timbre`. The fundamental frequency of a sound signal leads to our perception of the pitch. The higher the fundamental frequency, the higher the pitch. The larger the amplitude of the oscillation, the louder is the sound. Perception of loudness is on a logarithmic scale. Timbre refers to the `quality of the sound`. Timbre is determined by the `details of the repetitive pattern` of the sound signal.

Different `sequences of sound bites` give us our perception of speech and music! A note sung by Ming vs same note sung by Mei.

- [ ] Understand the concept of sound bites. 

So pure sinusoidal signals only have simple periodic variations. But periodic signals generated by piano and voices are generally more complex! comm
