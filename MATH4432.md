### Overview

**Classification**

- A special form of supervised learning
- Categorical or qualitative responses
- Predict the class of subject based on the inputs
- Logistic Regression; Linear discriminant analysis and KNN
- Generalized additive model (GAM); Trees, random forests and boosting; and SVM



**Why not regression**

- Coding Qualitative response as numerical, such as 0,1,2,..., are generally inappropriate.
- In some cases, response classes are ordered, such as severe/moderate/mild; tall/medium/short.
- Coding these into 0,1,2 as numericals and apply regression can still be inappropriate, because it implies the differences between the adjacent classes are equal.

**Special Case is binary response**

- Code the response into 0 and 1 and apply linear regression produce same result as LDA
