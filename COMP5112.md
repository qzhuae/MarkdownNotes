# COMP5112 Parallel Programming

## Introduction to Parallel Computing


From 1986 – 2002, microprocessors were speeding like a rocket, increasing in performance an average of 50% per year. Since then, it’s dropped to about 20% increase per year.

[An intelligent solution] Instead of designing and building faster microprocessors, put multiple processors on a single integrated circuit.

Why do we need ever-increasing performance?
Computational power is increasing, but so are our computation problems and needs. Problems we never dreamed of have been solved, such as decoding the human genome. More complex problems are still waiting to be solved. Such as,  Climate Modeling, Protein folding, Drug discovery, Energy Research, Data analysis.

Up to now, performance increases have been attributable to increasing density of transistors. But there are inherent problems:
- Denser transistors -> faster processors
- Faster processors -> increased power consumption
- Increased power consumption -> increased heat
- Increased heat -> unreliable processors

Solution is to move away from single-core systems to multicore processors. "core" = central processing unit (CPU) by introducing parallelsim
