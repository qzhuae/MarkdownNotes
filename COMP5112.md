# COMP5112 Parallel Programming

## Introduction to Parallel Computing


From 1986 – 2002, microprocessors were speeding like a rocket, increasing in performance an average of 50% per year. Since then, it’s dropped to about 20% increase per year.

[An intelligent solution] Instead of designing and building faster microprocessors, put multiple processors on a single integrated circuit.

Why do we need ever-increasing performance?
